# Story 3.8: Handle conflicting recommendations neutrally with evidence

### Story 3.8: Handle conflicting recommendations neutrally with evidence
**FRs covered:** FR23

As a Busy Community Member,
I want conflicting opinions to be summarized neutrally with citations,
So that I can decide without reading the whole chat.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the evidence indicates disagreement
**When** the bot formats the Top 3 response
**Then** it explicitly notes the disagreement in neutral language
**And** provides citations + dates that support each side.
